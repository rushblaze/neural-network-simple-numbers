# Introduction
Simple neural network for number recognition.

# Setup
## Environment
* Get the Python compiler from https://www.python.org/.
* Get the Eclipse IDE from https://www.eclipse.org/.
* Get PyDev from the Eclipse Marketplace.
* [Get eGit from the Eclipse Marketplace, if it is not already shipped with the distribution.]
## Sources
* Checkout this repository from https://github.com/rushblaze/neural-network-simple-numbers
* Checkout python sources for MNIST library from https://github.com/sorki/python-mnist

# Development
## MNIST / EMNIST
For our input data we try to reduce the efforts on our side and use sources from MNIST / EMNIST. There seems to be a library for python as well that we might utilize at https://pypi.org/project/python-mnist/.

## Neural Network
For the setup of a neural network we might utilize  http://pybrain.org/
